Write Code and connections in wokwi for ultrasonic sensor. whatever distance is less than 100 cms send “Alert” to ibm cloud aand display in device recent events. 
Code 
 //Pins 
const int TRIG_PIN = 7 ;  const int ECHO_PIN = 8; 
 
//Anything over 400 cm (23200 us pulse) is "out of range"  const unsigned int MAX_DIST = 23200; 
 
void setup() { 
 
// The Trigger pin will tell the sensor to range find  Pin Mode(TRIG_PIN, OUTPUT);  digital Write(TRIG_PIN, LOW); 
 
//Set Echo pin as input to measure the duration of  //pulses coming back from the distance sensor  pinMode(ECHO_PIN, INPUT ) ; 
 
// We'll use the serial monitor to view the sensor output 
 Serial.begin(9600); 
} 
void loop() { unsigned long t1; unsigned long t2;  unsigned long pulse_width;  float cm;  float inches; 
// Hold the trigger pin high for at least 10 us digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, HIGH);  delayMicroseconds(10);  digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW); 
 
// Wait for pulse on echo pin while (digitalRead( ECHO_PIN )==0 ); 
 
// Measure how long the echo pin was held high (pulse width)  // Note: the micros() counter will overflow after-70 min  t1= micros (); 
  while (digitalRead(ECHO_PIN) == 1);    t2= micros ();    pulse_width = t2-t1; 
 
 // Calculate distance in centimeters and inches. The constants 
 //are found in the datasheet, and calculated from the assumed speed 
 // of sound in air at sea level (- 340m/s)  cm=pulse_Width / 58 ;  inches = pulse_width/148.0; 
 
// Print out results if (pulse_width >MAX _ DIST ){ 
Serial.println("Out of range"); 
} else { 
Serial.println("*******************************”); 
Serial.print("The Measured Distance in cm: "); 
Serial.println(cm); 
 
if( cm < 100 ){ 
      //while(true){ 
       Serial.println(“Alert!!”); 
       //} 
} 
Serial.print(“***********************************”); 
} 
//wait at least 1000ms before next measurement 
Delay(1000); 
} 
 







 
Output: 
1.If the distance is less than 100 centimeters,it alerts. 
 
 
 
2.If the distance is more than 100 centimeters,it won’t alert 
 
  
3.Simulation and Code execution
